# Security

We take security very seriously. That's why we put an extra effort in encrypting all connections.

All connections are made over HTTPS (Secure HTTP) and WSS (Secure WebSocket).

We also sign all the requests with a *signature* composed of a public and private key so you can ensure the request was made from Prudio servers.
