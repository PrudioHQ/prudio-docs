# Performance and Speed

We set the goal to be fast and that's why we deliver our content thru a global Content Delivery Network (CDN).

At Prudio we use [KeyCDN](https://www.keycdn.com/?a=5066) as our CDN provider.

Our data is stored around the globe. The short distance to users will not only reduce latency but also minimize packet loss. All these factors will result in a much better performance.

Requests are always routed to the nearest available location. If one server is not available, requests are automatically sent to the next available server. The end-user will not notice any change.

## Asynchronous Loading

We load our client asynchronous so your page will maintain the same performance has before.
