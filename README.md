## How to edit the documentation

To build and publish the documentation we use [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). So the first step is to install it:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then to preview your changes locally, run the following command:

    mkdocs serve

Once everything is done, you can publish to the Github Pages of your forked repository to do a final check:

    mkdocs gh-deploy

Finally submit your pull-request.
