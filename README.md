## Connect your website to your Slack team

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/prudio](https://assembly.com/prudio).

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.

## How to edit the documentation

To build and publish the documentation we use [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). So the first step is to install it:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then to preview your changes locally, run the following command:

    mkdocs serve

Once everything is done, you can publish to the Github Pages of your forked repository to do a final check:

    mkdocs gh-deploy

Finally submit your pull-request.
